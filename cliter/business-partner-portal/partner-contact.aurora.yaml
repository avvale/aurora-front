description: |
  Contact persons associated with business partners. Manages individual contacts within partner organizations, including their roles, contact information, and communication preferences. Each contact belongs to exactly one business partner (many-to-one relationship). Contacts can optionally have portal access credentials via one-to-one relationship with iam/user, enabling them to authenticate and perform operations in the Business Partner Portal. Used for targeted communications, relationship management, and portal access control. Related modules: business-partner (parent entity), iam/user (portal credentials).
